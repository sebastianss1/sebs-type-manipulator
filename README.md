# Sebastian's Type Manipulator 

## Background

I have always been interested in graphic design and typefaces. Sebastian's Type Manipulator is a study of manipulating typefaces by using Javascript. This project studies the movement, color, size and scale of words. 

There will be many ways to manipulate text, outlined in the Functionality & MVP and Bonus Features sections.

## Functionality & MVP
With Sebastian's Type Manipulator, users will be able to:

* Type any words or phrases of their own (limit 100 characters)
* Toggle between multiple colors 
* Toggle movement and rotation of words
* Select different shapes a word can create i.e. cubes or cylinders 
* Reset all changes

In addition, this project will include:

* An About modal describing how to use the Type Manipulator 
* A production README

## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a text input area and some levers to change toggle between all settings listed in the Functionality and MVP section. The app will also have nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn, and the About modal.

## Architecture and Technologies
NB: one of the main things you should be researching and deciding upon while you write this proposal is what technologies you plan to use. Identify and create a plan of attack for the major technical challenges in your project.

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* Javascript
* p5js


## Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Learn as much as possible about p5js and how I can use it for my project. Set up all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running. Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above. 

Day 2: Continue researching the best way to implement this project.

Day 3: Start coding

Day 4: Continue coding and finalize.
